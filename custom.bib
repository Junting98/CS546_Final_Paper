The system consists of 16 IBM POWER9 servers with 4 NVIDIA V100 GPUs each, interconnected with Mellanox EDR InfiniBand fabric, and a DDN all-flash storage array. The system is tailored towards efficient execution of the IBM Watson Machine Learning enterprise software stack that combines popular open-source deep learning frameworks. We build a custom management software stack to enable an efficient use of the system by a diverse community of users and provide guides and recipes for running deep learning workloads at scale utilizing all available GPUs. We demonstrate scaling of a PyTorch and TensorFlow based deep neural networks to produce state-of-the-art performance results.}, booktitle = {Practice and Experience in Advanced Research Computing}, pages = {41–48}, numpages = {8}, keywords = {high-performance computing, cluster architecture, deep learning}, location = {Portland, OR, USA}, series = {PEARC '20} }
