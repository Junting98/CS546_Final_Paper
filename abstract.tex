Event types are usually predefined while the ontology of event types keep expanding and changing in the real word scenarios. Fine-tuning existing state-of-the-art event detection models for continual event detection task always suffers from high computation cost or catastrophic forgetting. We propose to adapt a meta-learning based framework to address the issues in continual learning. The proposed framework is composed of two modules, Representation Module and Adaption Module and training with the objective of Online-aware Meta-learning.  In the project, we simulate the long-tail distribution of new event types and formulate a new event detection task: continual few-shot event detection. Experiments results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method that significantly outperforms the classical fine-tune and pretrain + finetune method and is on par with state-of-the-art continual event detection models.
