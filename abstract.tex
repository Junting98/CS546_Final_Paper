Event types are usually predefined while the ontology of event types keep expanding and changing in the real word scenarios. Continual event detection always suffers from high computation cost or catastrophic forgetting. We propose to adapt a meta-learning based framework to address the issues in continual learning. The proposed framework is composed of two modules, Representation Module and Adaption Module
