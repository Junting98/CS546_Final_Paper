Event types are usually predefined while the ontology of event types keep expanding and changing in the real word scenarios. Continual event detection always suffers from high computation cost or catastrophic forgetting. We propose to adapt a meta-learning based framework to address the issues in continual learning. The proposed framework is composed of two modules, Representation Module and Adaption Module and training with the objective of Online-aware Meta-learning. Experiments results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method that significantly outperforms the classical pretrain + finetune method.
